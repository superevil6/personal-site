A personal website I made for fun and for business. Wow!

To get this up and running on your machine for whatever reason, please follow these steps:
1. Make sure you have Node and NPM installed on your machine.
2. Clone the project with git.
3. CD into the directory and run npm install. 
4. Run npm start and watch as the magic happens.
5. Celebrate, and try not to wonder strange and depressing things. Focus on the good! You're a beautiful person.
